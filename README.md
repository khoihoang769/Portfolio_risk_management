# Portfolio_risk_management

This project is built for streamline the use of calculating portfolio's key features and portfolio optimization.

This project comprises of one main file OOP_Financial_Info_2.py where it used Object-Oriented programming to generate instances, i.e building the components of the portfolio, and further calculate portfolio's features. In addition, there are several functions files where the main file imports to create a more comprehensive tool.

There are a lot of already built python projects to tackle different financial problems. However, these projects are facing the same disadvantanges: 
1) When there is an insight that requires different solvers together, it is complicated to combine different projects written by different people.
2) Generating various portfolios with different assets will be time consuming when used separated projects.
The main advantage of this project over other separated projects is that this project create a tool where users can freely modify the composition in their porfolios and use combination solvers to look for the important insights without any mentioned difficulties.

One python file which imports the project's files can generate a portfolio or be used to calculate the features based on the user's intention. Please find the EquitySimPortfolio.py file for the use of this project to support trading on the EquitySim platform.
