# Portfolio_risk_management

This project is built for streamline the use of calculating portfolio's key features and portfolio optimization.

This project comprises of one main file OOP_Financial_Info_2.py where it used Object-Oriented programming to generate instances, i.e building the components of the portfolio, and further calculate portfolio's features. In addition, there are several functions files where the main file imports to create a more comprehensive tool.

One python file which imports the project's files can generate a portfolio or be used to calculate the features based on the user's intention. Please find the EquitySimPortfolio.py file for the use of this project to support trading on the EquitySim platform.
